	```

1. Navigate to the created directory and install dependencies:

	```sh
	cd my-theme/
	pnpm install
	```

1. Run the playground to generate types for theme development and preview any changes:

	```sh

	```

## Setup Manually

If you are creating a theme inside an existing repository, you will have to set things up manually:

<Steps>

1. Create a package directory with the following structure:

	<FileTree>
	- package/
		- public/
		- src/
			- assets/
			- components/
			- layouts/
			- pages/
			- styles/
		- index.ts
		- package.json
		- README.md
	</FileTree>

1. Create a playground directory to generate types and test changes:

	```sh
	pnpm create astro@latest playground --template minimal --no-git -y
	```

	<FileTree>
	- playground/
		- public/
		- src/
		- astro.config.mjs
		- package.json
		- tsconfig.json
	</FileTree>

1. Add the package and playground directories to the workspace:

	```yaml
	// pnpm-workspace.yaml
	packages:
		- 'package'
		- 'playground'
	```

1. Add the theme package to the playground's `package.json` and re-install dependencies:

	```json
	// playground/package.json
	{
		"dependencies": {
			"astro": "^4.9.0",
			"my-theme": "workspace:^"
		}
	}
	```

	```sh
	pnpm install
	```

1. Add the theme package to the `integrations` array inside the playground's Astro configuration:

	```ts
	// playground/astro.config.mjs
	import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
	import myTheme from 'my-theme';

	export default defineConfig({
		integrations: [
			myTheme({
				// ...
			}),
		]
	});
	```

1. Run the playground to generate types for theme development and preview any changes

	```sh
	pnpm --filter playground dev
	```

</Steps>
