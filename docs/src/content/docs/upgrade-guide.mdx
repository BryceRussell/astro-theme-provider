import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## `0.4.0`

### Renamed: Virtual Imports

Virtual imports have been updated to follow [conventions for virtual modules](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html#virtual-modules-convention). This fix now allows theme packages use an `export` property inside the `package.json` without breaking.

```diff
- import { Component } from 'my-theme/components'
- import 'my-theme/styles'
+ import { Component } from 'my-theme:components'
+ import 'my-theme:styles'
```

### Renamed: Default module for styling

The default module for styling `css` has been renamed to `styles`

```diff
- import 'my-theme/css'
+ import 'my-theme:styles'
```

Make sure to also update the name of the folder inside of your theme

<FileTree>
- package/
	- src/
		- **css/** \<- Rename to "styles"
			- ...
</FileTree>
