## Theme Context

### Check Installed Integrations

The context module contains a list of all integrations running inside the user's project.
This list can be used to support [conditionally injected integrations](#conditionally-inject-integrations) or integrations that may be used alongside a theme.
For example:

```ts
// package/src/pages/index.astro
---
import { integrations } from 'my-theme:context'
---

/*
	The integration "@inox-tools/sitemap-ext" has
	a special API for per-route configurations

	Themes can opt-in to this alternative sitemap integration
	by checking for the existence of the integration and providing a value
*/
if (integrations.has('@inox-tools/sitemap-ext')) {
		import('sitemap-ext:config')
			.then(({ default: sitemap }) => sitemap(true))
}
```

### Get Final Pattern of Injected Routes

Routes injected by the Theme Provider can be overwritten and disabled. The context module contains a map of all possibly injected routes and their final pattern.

```tsx
// package/src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro
---
import { pages } from 'my-theme:context'
---

if (pages.get('/blog')) {
	<a href={pages.get('/blog')}></a>
}
```
