## What is Astro Theme Provider?

Astro Theme provider is a tool for authoring theme integrations.
Themes can be authored inside a package similar to a normal Astro project and published as an integration for others to use.

## Why use Astro Theme Provider?

###  Problems with current themes

In Astro, typically a theme is authored as a complete project and published as a template that users can clone and customize.
Theme templates are a very common pattern, but this pattern has many downsides that theme authors may not be aware of:

- **Not beginner friendly**: The largest demographic for theme users are people who are new to Astro and web development in general. Project templates can be hard to setup and understand for new developers.
- **Cannot be updated easily**: Merging improvements from a template can be difficult if not impossible after customizing your local copy of the template.
- **Cannot be used in existing projects**: Templates are authored as complete Astro projects, you cannot use templates inside existing projects.

### A better way to create themes

A better way to create themes is shifting away from project templates and towards Astro integrations.
Integrations have many different advantages over a traditional template, but the largest one is that integrations can be consumed from an NPM package.
This allows users to:

- Install themes with a single command: `astro add my-theme`
- Update themes with a single command: `pnpm upgrade my-theme`
- Use a theme inside of an existing project
- Use multiple themes together inside a single project
- Manage and configure themes from the Astro config

Although theme integrations may be more user-friendly, they are much harder to author and require a deeper level of knowledge about Astro and Vite to create.
Astro Theme Provider solves this by allowing theme authors to create theme integrations without having to write any integration code.
Themes can be authored inside packages similar to a normal Astro project and exported as an integration for others to use.

### Real-world Example

The best example of a theme integration, and pioneer of the pattern, is [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/).
Starlight allows you to build an entire documentation website with a object for configuration and some markdown.
It has become one of the most popular themes for Astro because it is easy to setup and use.
Starlight's success proves that theme integrations are a powerful pattern that have been under utilized in the Astro ecosystem and Astro Theme Provider wants to change that!
