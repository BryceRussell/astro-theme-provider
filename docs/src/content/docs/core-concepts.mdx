## Authoring a Theme

Authoring a theme integration with Astro Theme Provider is simple, but there are a few core concpets that one must know before getting started.

### Project Structure

Themes are authored inside of monorepositories. A theme lives inside a package with a structure similar to a normal Astro project:

<FileTree>
- package/
	- public/
	- src/
		- assets/
		- components/
		- layouts/
		- pages/
		- styles/
	- index.ts
	- README.md
	- package.json
</FileTree>

Themes must be authored alongside a playground.
The playground is responsible for generating types during development and previewing changes to the theme.

<FileTree>
- playground/
	- public/
	- src/
	- astro.config.mjs
	- tsconfig.json
	- package.json
</FileTree>


### Theme Config

Themes have a built-in config that can be configured by a user.
Theme authors can define a shape for this user configuration with a zod schema.

```ts
// package/index.ts
import defineTheme from 'astro-theme-provider';
import { z } from 'astro/zod';

export default defineTheme({
	name: 'my-theme',
	schema: z.object({
		title: z.string(),
		description: z.string().optional()
	})
})
```

The user configuration is used to customize pages and components inside the theme:

```tsx
// package/src/pages/index.astro
---
import config from 'my-theme:config'
---

<html>
	<head>
		<title>{config.title}</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>{config.title}</h1>
		<p>{config.description}</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

The theme config has to be JSON serializable. Values like functions and classes do not work inside of theme configurations.


### Theme Context

Themes are *dynamic*, they can be used inside a variety of projects with different combinations of user configurations and enviroments.
To account for this, all themes have a built-in utilities for information about the context the theme is running in. For example:

```tsx
---
import { pages, integrations } from 'my-theme:context'

if (integrations.has('some-integration')) {
	// Do something because an integration is installed
}
---

{/* Check if route was injected and link to it */}
{ pages.get('/blog') &&
	<a href={pages.get('/blog')}></a>
}
```

This allows theme authors to create dynamic themes that adapt to a user's project and configuration

### Virtual Modules

Virtual modules are used by authors to access components and assets insde a theme

<FileTree>
- package/
	- src/
		- assets/
			- logo.png
		- components/
			- Hero.astro
		- layouts/
			- Layout.astro
		- styles/
			- global.css
</FileTree>

```tsx
// package/src/pages/index.astro
---
import { Layout } from 'my-theme:lauouts';
import { Hero } from 'my-theme:components';
import { logo } from 'my-theme:assets';
import "my-theme:styles";
---

<Layout>
	<Hero image={logo} />
</Layout>
```

These components and assets can be overriden by a user allowing for complete customization of a theme.

## Using a Theme

Once a theme has been authored and published to NPM, a user can add it to their project with a single command:

```sh
pnpm astro add my-theme
```

This will install the theme package and add it to the `integrations` array inside the Astro config:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import myTheme from 'my-theme';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    myTheme({
			// ...
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Configuring

User's can configure a theme using the `config` option defined by the author:

```ts
myTheme({
	config: {
		title: 'My Theme!'
	}
})
```

### Overriding

Themes can be overriden for complete cusomtization by the user, for example:

**Overriding routes**:

```ts
myTheme({
	pages: {
		// Toggling routes off
		"/404": false,
		// Renaming injected routes
		"/blog": "/posts",
	}
})
```

**Overriding styles**:

```ts
myTheme({
	overrides: {
		// Append styles to style module
		styles: [
			'./src/styles/override.css'
		]
	}
})
```

**Overriding an image inside the theme**:

```ts
myTheme({
	overrides: {
		// Override components/assets inside the theme
		assets: {
			logo: './src/assets/custom-logo.png'
		}
	}
})
```

**Disabling integrations**:

```ts
myTheme({
	integrations: {
		// Disable an integration from being injected
		"@astrojs/sitemap": false
	}
})
```
