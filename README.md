# `astro-theme-provider`

Easily create theme integrations for Astro

### [Documentation](https://github.com/BryceRussell/astro-theme-provider/tree/master/packages/astro-theme-provider#readme)

### Work In Progress

Currently this package works and can be used to create themes, but the shape of the API may change in the future!

I am still doing a lot thinking about how to support everything a theme author may need with an easy-to-use API. If you have any ideas or use cases that you want included you can open a discussion in the [discussions tab](https://github.com/BryceRussell/astro-theme-provider/discussions)
